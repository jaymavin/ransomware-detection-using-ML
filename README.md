# Detecting Ransomware using Behavioural Features and Machine Learning
In this project, I used the behavioural features (entropy) of various ransomware families to train machine learning models to detect ransomware.

The dataset used in this project is the RanSAP Dataset of Ransomware Storage Access Patterns. This can be found here: https://github.com/manabu-hirano/RanSAP/
